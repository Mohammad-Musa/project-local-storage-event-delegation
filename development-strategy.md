# Development Strategy

> `project-local-storage-event-delegation`

A beginner project where we work collaboratively on Document Object Model. That is a small site with sort of tapas menu, where site-visitor can add things which save in menu after refresh the page. And also if site-visitor want he can check and uncheck menu items.  
For the aim to alive the page it's added css-effects: shadow move mouse and spacing/blur/base color.
